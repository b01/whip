Whip gives you a foundation for building web pages with forms.

## Description

Whip acts as the foundation of a website. It provides interfaces and abstract
classes for building pages and forms (including validation). It also include a
standard library containing utility functionality for common web related task.

Whip lays out how you should build your website pages and forms; so you do not
have think about, and so that its done in a consistent standard manner. When
combined with a framework like [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/), it can
make building a site, from the ground up, streamlined and fast.

Whip is NOT a framework. Its meant to work with micro-frameworks that do not
provide guidance on how to build pages or form. 

The great thing about Whip is that its small (minimal code).
